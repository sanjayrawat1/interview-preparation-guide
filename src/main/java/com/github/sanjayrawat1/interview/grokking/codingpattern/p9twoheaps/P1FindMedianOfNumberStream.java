/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/
 * <p>
 * Design a class to calculate the median of a number stream. The class should have the following two
 * methods:
 * <ol>
 *     <li> `insertNum(int num)`: stores the number in the class.
 *     <li> `findMedian()`: return the median of all numbers inserted in the class if the count of numbers
 *          inserted in the class is even, the median will be the average of the middle two numbers.
 * </ol>
 * Assume 'x' is the median of a list. This means that half of the numbers in the list will be smaller than
 * (or equal to) 'x' and half will be greater than (or equal to) 'x'. This leads us to the approach where we
 * can divide the list into two halves: one half to store all the smaller numbers and one half to store the
 * larger numbers. The median of all the numbers will either the largest number in the smaller half or the
 * smallest in the larger half. If the total number of elements is even, the median will be the average of
 * these two numbers.
 * <p>
 * The best data structure to find the smallest or largest number among a list of numbers is a Heap. Let's
 * see how we can use a heap to find a better algorithm:
 * <li> We can store the first half of numbers in a Max Heap, as we are interested in knowing the largest
 * number in the first half.
 * <li> We can store the second half of numbers in a Min Heap, as we are interested in knowing the smallest
 * number in the second half.
 * <li> Inserting a number in a heap will take O(log N).
 * <li> At any time, the median of the current list of numbers can be calculated from the top elements of
 * the two heaps.
