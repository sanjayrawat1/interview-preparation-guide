    /**
     * Since the given set can have duplicate numbers, if we follow the same approach discussed in subsets,
     * we will end up with duplicate subsets. To handle this, we will do two extra things:
     * <ol>
     *     <li> Sort all numbers of the given set. This will ensure that duplicate numbers are next to each other.
     *     <li> Whenever we are about to process a duplicate, instead of adding the current number (which is a
     *          duplicate) to all the existing subsets, only add it to the subsets which were created in the
     *          previous step.
     * </ol>
     * Letâ€™s take an example mentioned below to go through each step of our algorithm:
     * <br> Given set: [1, 5, 3, 3]
     * <br> Sorted set: [1, 3, 3, 5]
     * <ol>
     *     <li> Start with an empty set: [[]]
     *     <li> Add the first number 1 to all the existing subsets to create new subsets: [[], [1]];
     *     <li> Add the second number 3 to all the existing subsets: [[], [1], [3], [1,3]].
     *     <li> The next number 3 is a duplicate. If we add it to all existing subsets we will get:
     *          [[], [1], [3], [1,3], [3], [1,3], [3,3], [1,3,3]]
     *          <br> We got two duplicate subsets: [3], [1,3]
     *          <br> Whereas we only needed the new subsets: [3,3], [1,3,3]
     *          <br> To handle this instead of adding 3 to all the existing subsets, we only add it to the new subsets
     *          which were created in the previous 3rd step:
     *          [[], [1], [3], [1,3], [3,3], [1,3,3]]
     *     <li> Finally, add the forth number 5 to all the existing subsets: [[], [1], [3], [1,3], [3,3], [1,3,3],
     *          [5], [1,5], [3,5], [1,3,5], [3,3,5], [1,3,3,5]]
     * </ol>
