     * node, we iterate the current path. The current path, in the worst case, can be O(N) (in the case of
     * a skewed tree). But, if the tree is balanced, then the current path will be equal to the height of
     * the tree, i.e., O(logN). So the best case of our algorithm will be O(NlogN).
     * <li> The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N). This space will be used to store the
     * recursion stack. The worst case will happen when the given tree is a linked list (i.e., every node has
     * only one child). We also need O(N) space for storing the currentPath in the worst case. Overall space
     * complexity of our algorithm is O(N).
