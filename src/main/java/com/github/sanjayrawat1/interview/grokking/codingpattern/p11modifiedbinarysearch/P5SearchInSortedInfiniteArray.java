/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-sorted-array-of-unknown-size/
 * <p>
 * Given an infinite sorted array (or an array with unknown size), find if a given number 'key' is present
 * in the array. Write a function to return the index of the key if it is present in the array, otherwise
 * return -1.
 * <p>
 * Since it is not possible to define an array with infinite (unknown) size, you will be provided with an
 * interface `ArrayReader` to read elements of the array. `ArrayReader.get(index)` will return the number
 * at `index`; if array's size is smaller than the index, it will return `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.

     * The only issue with applying binary search in this problem is that we don't know the bounds of the
     * array. To handle this situation, we will first find the proper bounds of the array where we can
     * perform a binary search.
     * <p>
     * An efficient way to find the proper bounds is to start at the beginning of the array with the bound's
     * size as 1 and exponentially increase the bound's size (i.e., double it) until we find the bounds that
     * can have the key.
     *
     * <li> There are two parts of the algorithm. In the first part, we keep increasing the boundâ€™s size
     *      exponentially (double it every time) while searching for the proper bounds. Therefore, this step
     *      will take O(log N) assuming that the array will have maximum N numbers. In the second step,
     *      we perform the binary search which will take O(log N), so the overall time complexity of our
     *      algorithm will be O(log N + log N) which is asymptotically equivalent to O(log N).
     * <li> The algorithm runs in constant space O(1).
