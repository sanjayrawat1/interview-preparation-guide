     * Since we need to traverse all nodes of each level before moving onto the next level, we can use the
     * Breadth First Search (BFS) technique to solve this problem.
     * <br>
     * We can use a Queue to efficiently traverse in BFS fashion. Here are the steps of our algorithm:
     * <ol>
     *     <li> Start by pushing the root node to the queue.
     *     <li> Keep iterating until the queue is empty.
     *     <li> In each iteration, first count the elements in the queue (letâ€™s call it levelSize).
     *          We will have these many nodes in the current level.
     *     <li> Next, remove levelSize nodes from the queue and push their value in an array to represent the current level.
     *     <li> After removing each node from the queue, insert both of its children into the queue.
     *     <li> If the queue is not empty, repeat from step 3 for the next level.
     * </ol>
     *
     * <li> The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N), where N is the total number of nodes in the tree.
     * This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once.
     * <li> The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) as we need to return a list containing the level
     * order traversal. We will also need O(N) space for the queue. Since we can have a maximum of N/2 nodes at any
     * level (this could happen only at the lowest level), therefore we will need O(N) space to store them in the queue.
