/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/description/
 * <p>
 * You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change
 * it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.
 * <p>
 * Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the
 * above operations.
 * <li>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
 * <p>
 * Output: 4
 * <p>
 * Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
 * <li>
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
 * <p>
 * Output: 4
 * <p>
 * Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
 * The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
 * There may exists other ways to achieve this answer too.

     * <li> We will iterate through the string to add one letter at a time in the window.
     * <li> We will also keep track of the count of the maximum repeating letter in any window (let's call it maxRepeatedLetterCount).
     * <li> So, at any time, we know that we do have a window with one letter repeating `maxRepeatedLetterCount` times. This means we should try to replace
     * the remaining letters.
     *    <ul>
     *    <li> if the remaining letters are less than or equal to `k`, we can replace them all.
     *    <li> if we have more than `k` remaining letters, we should shrink the window as we cannot replace more than `k` letters.
     *    </ul>
     * <p>
     * While shrinking the window, we donâ€™t need to update maxRepeatedLetterCount. Since we are only interested in the longest valid substring,
     * our sliding windows do not have to shrink, even if a window may cover an invalid substring. Either we expand the window by appending
     * a character to the right, or we shift the entire window to the right by one. We only expand the window when the frequency of the
     * newly added character exceeds the historical maximum frequency (from a previous window that included a valid substring).
     * In other words, we do not need to know the exact maximum count of the current window. The only thing we need to know is whether the
     * maximum count exceeds the historical maximum count, and that can only happen because of the newly added char.
